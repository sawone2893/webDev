    <h2>Ironman Movie Part 1</h2>
    <p>
      <a>Iron Man</a> is a 2008 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics
      character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by
      Paramount Pictures,[a] it is the first film in the Marvel Cinematic
      Universe (MCU). Directed by Jon Favreau from a screenplay by the writing
      teams of Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway, the
      film stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man alongside Terrence
      Howard, Jeff Bridges, Gwyneth Paltrow, Leslie Bibb, and Shaun Toub. In the
      film, following his escape from captivity by a terrorist group,
      world-famous industrialist and master engineer Stark builds a mechanized
      suit of armor and becomes the superhero Iron Man.

      A film featuring Iron Man was in development at Universal Pictures, 20th
      Century Fox, and New Line Cinema at various times since 1990 before Marvel
      Studios reacquired the rights in 2005. Marvel put the project in
      production as its first self-financed film, with Paramount Pictures
      distributing. Favreau signed on as director in April 2006 and faced
      opposition from Marvel when trying to cast Downey in the title role; the
      actor was signed in September. Filming took place from March to June 2007,
      primarily in California to differentiate the film from numerous other
      superhero stories that are set in New York City. During filming, the
      actors were free to create their own dialogue because pre-production was
      focused on the story and action. Rubber and metal versions of the armor,
      created by Stan Winston's company, were mixed with computer-generated
      imagery to create the title character

      Iron Man premiered in Sydney on April 14, 2008, and was released in the
      United States on May 2, as the first film in Phase One of the MCU. It
      grossed over $585 million, becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of
      2008, and received praise from critics, especially for Downey's
      performance as well as Favreau's direction, the visual effects, action
      sequences, and writing. The American Film Institute selected it as one of
      the ten best films of 2008. It received two nominations at the 81st
      Academy Awards for Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects. In 2022,
      the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United
      States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or
      aesthetically significant". Two sequels have been released: Iron Man 2
      (2010) and Iron Man 3 (2013).
